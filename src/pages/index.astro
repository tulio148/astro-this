          question="Can I take photos or videos to post to my social media?"
          answer="Absolutely! We only ask two things: (1) try to be a stealthy ninja and avoid capturing any classmates if they are camera-shy, and (2) tag us @danceblocbrazil so we can shower your post with likes (because, let's face it, everyone loves a little social media validation, and you deserve it!). Sharing your dance journey can also inspire others to join our community!"

          question="Will I have to perform?"
          answer="Occasionally we have performance opportunities for our students and the spotlight is all yours, if you want it. But fear not, there's absolutely no pressure to perform if that's not your thing. We believe in having fun and learning at your own pace. So, come for the supportive atmosphere, stay for the killer dance moves, and perform only if you're feeling like a total superstar (which you will be!)"
