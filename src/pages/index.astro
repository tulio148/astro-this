      <FAQItem
        question="Do I need any prior dance experience to take your classes?"
        answer="Not at all! We offer classes for all levels and welcome everyone, from experienced dancers to those who've only danced as a guest at a wedding. We believe anyone can learn to love these rhythms and move their body with confidence! So come along for a dance, and see if you don't surprise yourself!"
      />

      <FAQItem
        question="What should I wear to class?"
        answer="Wear comfortable clothing that allows for movement. Comfortable shoes, like sneakers, are a great option. If you can wear it to the gym, you can wear it to dance! For women, leggings or dance pants with a comfortable top work well. For men, athletic shorts or pants with a t-shirt are perfect. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable and able to move freely."
      />

      <FAQItem
        question="Do I need a partner for the classes?"
        answer="No partner is necessary - that's the beauty of our classes. Of course, if you have a partner or friend who wants to join the fun, they're totally welcome, too. Our classes focus on individual technique and group choreography, creating a welcoming environment for everyone regardless of whether you come alone or with someone."
      />

      <FAQItem
        question="Do you offer drop-in classes?"
        answer="We totally understand that commitment is a scary word these days! That's why we're happy to offer drop-in classes and they are advertised as casual classes on the class bookings page. This gives you the flexibility to try different styles or accommodate your busy schedule. However, we do recommend regular attendance for the best progress in your dance journey."
      />

      <FAQItem
        question="What's the atmosphere like?"
        answer="We have a fun and welcoming atmosphere! Our classes are a great way to meet new people, learn a new skill and get some exercise. The energy is always positive, supportive, and focused on enjoying the experience. We pride ourselves on creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and encouraged to express themselves through dance."
      />

      <FAQItem
        question="Can I take photos or videos to post to my social media?"
        answer="Absolutely! We only ask two things: (1) try to be a stealthy ninja and avoid capturing any classmates if they are camera-shy, and (2) tag us @danceblocbrazil so we can shower your post with likes (because, let's face it, everyone loves a little social media validation, and you deserve it!). Sharing your dance journey can also inspire others to join our community!"
      />

      <FAQItem
        question="Will I have to perform?"
        answer="Occasionally we have performance opportunities for our students and the spotlight is all yours, if you want it. But fear not, there's absolutely no pressure to perform if that's not your thing. We believe in having fun and learning at your own pace. So, come for the supportive atmosphere, stay for the killer dance moves, and perform only if you're feeling like a total superstar (which you will be!)"
